          &emsp; My name is Dalton Weir and I am a diversely trained digital professional currently living in
          Edinburgh, Scotland. </br>
          &emsp; I was born and raised in Buffalo, NY – a medium sized, former “rust-belt” city in the Great Lakes
          region of the American northeast. As an immigrant city, Buffalo has been influenced by a
          conflagration of world traditions and cultures that shaped the city’s rich corporate and cultural
          tapestry. This combination of old-world traditions and new-world economic and cultural
          development has shaped much of who I am professionally and personally. </br>
          &emsp; In the nooks and crannies of that Pan-American labyrinth, I encountered a fusion of human
          delicacy and urban design. In Buffalo, you regularly pass by large surrealist murals and
          complicated graffiti adorning the faces of aged neoclassical buildings constructed at the turn of
          the century. My time spent sneaking through the run-down grain mills of ‘Silo City’ or riding my
          bike across town at 12 am on Sunday nights with 500 other adventurers taught me to notice
          the subtle nuances of connecting with others. When I moved to university, I carried those
          memories with me into my studies of literature, social culture, and digital spaces to find I was
          happiest when working with others to drive forward a future of inclusive technology. The
          cutting edge of new digital business provides space and resources for this ethos to flourish.</br>
          &emsp; Now, I am living and working in the UK – my chosen home – with teams and individuals that see
          this need and are working to drive the industry forward. As I continue my work, I hope to
          continue connecting with others in valuable, exciting ways and welcome those who wish to
          reach out regarding opportunities. For now, here is a portfolio of work – The Campaign of Me.
      </div>
      <div class="col-4 text-justify">
          &emsp; My public and professional persona is marked by a desire to improve the experiences of those
          who interact with the projects I work on. I truly believe that the smallest positive impact on
          someone’s experience can be significant. An accessible PDF here or well-designed product
          there could be the difference between a person exiting in frustration or discovering something
          special. The latter is what I want. More importantly, I hope it’s what we all want as digital
          professionals. If you feel the same, feel free to reach out and chat! </br>
          &emsp; I read articles by companies all the time about how they’re ‘rewriting the manual on [insert
          project here]’ or ‘changing the world with [insert solution here]’. That’s excellent if it works out,
          and I applaud them wholeheartedly for their incredible work. But often, I also see time,
          manpower, and funds disappear into these projects – resources that could impact user
          experience massively if applied to making products and solutions more inclusive. I feel that the
          small details matter because they show respect and care for the customer. </br>
          &emsp; In my work, I’ve committed myself to learning as much as I can about how accessible design
          impacts people’s experiences of products; then I observe these impacts through data collection
          and analysis. This information is then used to inform each project thereafter. Multidisciplinary
          teams and working styles are becoming more popular for a reason. Customers’ experiences
          reflect their fluid and diverse personalities, so it is important to connect with those
          personalities as best we can to maximise that experience. </br>
          &emsp; Check out my three CV versions below for more technical detail on my past positions!

      </div>
      <div class="col-4 text-justify">
          &emsp; Outside of work, I love to explore digital spaces – to travel the proverbial world of online
          interaction. Whether it be gaming, reading blogs, creating digital art, or teaching myself to
          code, I find myself learning constantly from the incredible people and products online. I
          suppose you could say I am a bit of a futurist. I love discovering the ways in which people today
          interact with and discuss the ideas and questions of tomorrow. If you ever want to talk about
          robots, just let me know! </br>
          &emsp; I’m also a big film buff. One of my favourite films is The Fifth Element starring Chris Tucker and
          Bruce Willis, and I’m also a very big Moulin Rouge fan. I’m a bit of a sucker for theatrical
          interpretations of modern pop and rock. As for music, I love R&amp;B, smooth alt-rock, electro
          swing, house, and classic jazz. </br>
          &emsp; Hang on there. I don’t want you thinking that I only watch movies and sit on my computer! I’m
          quite and active person and love playing post-work footy when I’m not at rugby practice. I also
          enjoy a night out with friends and coworkers and am always up for heading out for a coffee or
          lunch to get to know new friends and acquaintances better. Fancy some good coffee and a
          better chat? Just let me know! </br>
